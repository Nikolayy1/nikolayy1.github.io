## Description
No one enjoys doing chores, but they're a part of everyday life. That's why we're creating an app designed to make them more engaging and fun! Our app transforms boring household tasks into an interactive experience. It not only helps you stay organized by tracking your to-do list but also motivates you with a rewarding XP system. Earn experience points for every chore you complete, level up, and celebrate your progress.

## App Concept
### Use Case
Our app's primary use case is tracking household chores - keeping tabs on what's completed and what still needs attention. By integrating gamification through an XP system and rewards, the app encourages users to stay engaged and motivated. Users will feel a sense of accomplishment as they complete tasks and make progress in their Level.
