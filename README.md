## App Concept

Daily Quest is designed for individuals who want to stay productive while having fun. It provides a visual and interactive way to manage tasks by incorporating gamification elements like experience points, levels, and a task prioritization system. 
Users can:
-	Mark tasks as "Quick Board" for focused attention.
-	Earn XP and level up by completing tasks.
-	Allocate stat points (Endurance, Intelligence, Focus) as you progress.
This app helps users maintain productivity by creating a rewarding and enjoyable experience.

## Usability Test Plan
### Heuristic Evaluation
Using Nielsen's 10 we evaluated the current version of our app. Below are our findings:

#### 1. Visibility of System Status
- No clear indication that a quest got successfully created
- Search bar: No information provided to press on search button to complete the operation
- Filter: Not showing what filter is currently applied
- No confirmation that the edited quest got saved
- No Error Message when wanting to add more than 3 tasks to quick board

#### 2. User Control and Freedom
- Once marking a quest as completed, it's gone (no undo option)

#### 3. Error Prevention
- Users can leave the edited quest without saving
- Users could try to mark more than 3 tasks on the quick board

#### 4. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- Icons rely heavily on the user knowing what they do (like saving, deleting, ...)

#### 5. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- Beige color might feel less engaging to users (try new color schemes)

#### 6. Help and Documentation
- New users might not know the system of EXP/Leveling/Stats
